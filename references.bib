We find that the transmission characteristics over a wide range of optical depth can be fully accounted for as optical coherent transients excited by the wide spectral content of the square-modulated optical pulse. We show that both time-domain atom-field coupled equations and frequency-domain linear dispersion theory give precisely the same description of the optical transients at a weak power limit. At low optical depth with moderate absorption, resonant excitation dominates and free-induction decay (FID) contributes mostly to the transient field. At high optical depth when absorption and propagation effects become significant, lossless optical precursors start to dominate the transient response. By varying the optical depth from 0 to 45, we observe that optical transients evolve gradually from FID to optical precursors. We thus show that FID and optical precursors, which have been considered as two different optical transients for many decades, can be unified within a single theoretical frame and they are the manifestations of the same physical process in two different regimes. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

The weak dispersion limit is obtained as the material density decreases to zero. The material dispersion then becomes vanishingly small everywhere and the precursors become increasingly compressed in the space-time domain immediately following the speed-of-light point (z, t)=(z,z/c).

	abstract = {An efficient method for the calculation of the interactions of a 2m factorial experiment was introduced by Yates and is widely known by his name. The generalization to 3m was given by Box et al. [1]. Good [2] generalized these methods and gave elegant algorithms for which one class of applications is the calculation of Fourier series. In their full generality, Good's methods are applicable to certain problems in which one must multiply an JV-vector by an JV X N matrix which can be factored into m sparse matrices, where m is proportional to log JV. This results in a procedure requiring a number of operations proportional to JV log JV rather than JV2. These methods are applied here to the calculation of complex Fourier series. They are useful in situations where the number of data points is, or can be chosen to be, a highly composite number. The algorithm is here derived and presented in a rather different form. Attention is given to the choice of JV. It is also shown how special advantage can be obtained in the use of a binary computer with JV = 2m and how the entire calculation can be performed within the array of JV data storage locations used for the given Fourier coefficients. Consider the problem of calculating the complex Fourier series (1) XiJ)=ZAik)-Wjk, ¿«0,1, ...,iV-l, *-0 where the given Fourier coefficients Aik) are complex and W is the principal JVth root of unity, (2) W = e2rilN.

The algorithm described here iterates on the array of given complex Fourier amplitudes and yields the result in less than 2JV Iog2 JV operations without requiring more data storage than is required for the given array A.

abstract = {This article presents a study of the propagation of small-area pulses of coherent light through matter. It is found that the small-area pulses exactly obey an area theorem which, in the case of an attenuating medium, requires that the pulse area decay to zero exponentially with increasing distance of propagation. This, however, does not necessarily imply that the pulse energy decays exponentially. Instead, it is found that pulses of duration comparable to or shorter than the transverse relaxation time of the medium T2 (including both homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening) propagate with low energy loss. The results are explained in terms of simple physical arguments which indicate that the pulse envelope should oscillate between positive and negative values, causing the area to decrease without a comparable decrease in the pulse energy. Analytic solutions are presented for the case of a pulse whose envelope varies as tke-t for t{\textgreater}0, a rectangular pulse, an ultrashort pulse (i.e., pulse width much less than T2), and the leading portion of a step-function pulse. The propagation of a small-area Gaussian pulse is studied numerically. {\textcopyright} 1970 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Optical physics is concerned with the dynamical interactions of atoms and molecules with electromagnetic to fields. Semiclassical theories, which study the interaction of atoms with classical fields, are often said to comprise optical physics, while quantum optics treats the interaction of atoms or molecules with quantized electromagnetic fields. A significant part of optical physics and quantum optics is the study of near-resonant atom-field interactions, and concentrates on nonperturbative dynamics, where the effects of the optical fields have to be kept to all orders. The atomic properties themselves are assumed to be known. The vast majority of problems in light-matter interactions can be treated quite accurately within light-matter interactionsemiclassical approximationlight-matter interactionsemiclassicalquantumopticslight-matter interactionquantized fields semiclassical theories. However, an important class of problems where this is not the case are presented in Chapt. 78. While much of optical physics and quantum optics ignores the effects of the electromagnetic fields on the center-of-mass motion of the atoms, important topics such as atomic trapping and cooling (Chapt. 75) and de Broglie optics (Chapt. 77) rely in an essential way on such mechanical effects of light. The present chapter deals with more “traditional” aspects of optical physics, where these effects are ignored.},

Combining direct Laplace-Fourier integration and calculations by the saddle-point method, we establish an explicit analytical expression of the transmitted field valid at any time, even when the two forerunners significantly overlap. We examine how their complete overlapping, occurring for shorter propagation distances, originates the formation of the unique transient currently named resonant precursor or dynamical beat. We obtain an expression of this transient identical to that usually derived within the slowly varying envelope in spite of the initial discontinuity of the incident field envelope. The dynamical beats and 0$\pi$ pulses generated by ultra-short incident pulses are also briefly examined.},

Starting from Maxwell's equation, the weakly dispersive, narrow resonance approximation is used to derive expressions for the time evolution of the precursor field. This main result is expanded to develop expressions that ac- count for step pulses with finite rise time, a series of rectangular pulses and phase modulated inputs. Optical precursors are experimentally observed in cold rubidium gas in a magneto-optical trap. For the case of a single rectangular modulated pulse, the transmitted field is seen to depend on the detuning of the carrier frequency from the medium's resonance frequency. For a series of step modulated pulses, a stacking effect between multiple precursor field is achieved by using constructive interference between the modulation patterns that arise for off-resonance precursors.},

We point out that the precursors are visible only at propagation distances such that the impulse response of the medium is essentially determined by the frequency dependence of its absorption and is practically Gaussian. By simple convolution, we then obtain explicit analytical expressions of the transmitted waves generated by reference incident waves, distinguishing precursor and main signal by a simple examination of the long-time behavior of the overall signal. These expressions are in good agreement with the signals obtained in numerical or real experiments performed on water in the radio-frequency domain and explain in particular some observed shapes of the precursor. Results are obtained for other remarkable incident waves. In addition, we show quite generally that the shape of the Brillouin precursor appearing alone at sufficiently large propagation distance and the law giving its amplitude as a function of this distance do not depend on the precise form of the incident wave but only on its integral properties. The incidence of a static conductivity of the medium is also examined and explicit analytical results are again given in the limit of weak and strong conductivities.},

@phdthesis{Kwong2017,
abstract = {We study the coherent transmission of light through cold strontium atomic clouds, using the narrow intercombination line. In the first part of the thesis, the cooperative emission in the coherent transmission is studied experimentally. By applying fast changes to the incident probe field, flashes of light are observed in the forward direction. The peak intensity of the flashes can be much larger than the incident intensity. These flashes are called superflashes. Due to cooperative effect, the time scale of the flashes are shortened with respect to the single scatterer lifetime. By packing these flashes, we generate a pulse train with short repetition time, where the dynamics can almost be fully governed by cooperative effect. The effect of atomic density on the coherent transmission of light is also studied theoret- ically and numerically. The effective refractive index of the cloud is calculated up to the second order in atomic density. It is eventually validated with a numerical simulation of the coherent light transmission. The second part of the thesis focuses on the effect of magnetic field on the co- herent transmission of light. The strontium intercombination line has a sensitivity in the milligauss regime, which is the typical value of stray magnetic field in the lab. An active magnetic field control system is implemented to cancel the low fre- quency and AC 50 Hz stray magnetic field. Using this control system, we study the nonlinear magneto-optical rotation (NMOR) effect due to a high intensity light field transmitting through a dilute and thin cloud of strontium atom. Interestingly, at sufficiently high cloud temperature, the NMOR effect can have a higher sensi- tivity to the magnetic field, compared to its linear counterpart at the same cloud temperature.},

Within the framework of a diagrammatic representation method, we identify all the second-order diagrams that enter into the description of the relative permittivity for coherent light transmission.

Using coupled dipole equations, we numerically simulate the coherent transmission with scalar and vector waves and find good agreement with the perturbative calculations.

A molecular sample which is coherently prepared by a cw laser beam exhibits such a decay when it is suddenly switched out of resonance by a Stark field. Observations are presented for a nondegenerate Doppler-broadened infrared transition of NH2D, where the sample is optically thin, and the decay behavior can be compared quantitatively with a solution of the Bloch equations. When the molecular sample is prepared under steady-state conditions, the solutions are analytic; for pulse excitation, a numerical solution is required. The treatment invokes a hard-collision relaxation model. Such characteristics as the abrupt termination of the decay and the related edge echo, which result from Doppler dephasing, can be examined for Stark pulses of finite extent. {\textcopyright} 1972 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Foster1974,
abstract = {A new feature of optical free induction decay (FID) is observed in a coherently prepared sample of CH13F3 by the method of Stark switching. The preparative phase is due to the resonant steady-state excitation by a cw laser beam, and is followed by FID upon sudden application of a dc Stark field that switches the molecular sample out of resonance. The emission is not observed as a simple decay but instead appears as a train of sharp pulses regularly spaced in time as a result of a repetitive interference. This situation arises because an entire set of infrared transitions within the Stark split manifold are initially prepared, in contrast to our previous study of a nondegenerate transition. The emission, which beats with the laser, produces a heterodyne beat spectrum, consisting of a set of regularly spaced frequencies, that is the Fourier transform of the slowly decaying pulse progression observed. We thus demonstrate what is the optical analog of the well-known NMR method of high-resolution pulse Fourier spectroscopy. The detailed behavior of the pulse train agrees well with an FID theory that assumes the transitions to be uncoupled. The subtle behavior of FID near the time origin is explored also by approximate analytic expressions that reveal either a near zero amplitude or sizable amplitude depending on the degree of saturation in the preparative stage. The experimental technique discussed offers an attractive way for obtaining high-resolution optical spectra without Doppler broadening, and for generating an optical pulse train whose time scale can be compressed by simply increasing the Stark field. {\textcopyright} 1974 The American Physical Society.},

Here, we demonstrate this effect experimentally by directly measuring the decay rate of the off-axis fluorescence of a large and dilute cloud of cold rubidium atoms after the sudden switch-off of a low-intensity laser driving the atomic transition. We show that, at large detuning, the decay rate increases with the on-resonance optical depth.

abstract = {We develop a theory of electromagnetically induced transparency in a three-level, ladder-type Doppler-broadened medium, paying special attention to the case where the coupling and probe beams are counterpropagating and have similar frequencies, so as to reduce the total Doppler width of the two-photon process. The theory is easily generalized to deal with the configuration, where the ideal arrangement involves two copropagating beams. We discuss different possible regimes, depending on the relative importance of the various broadening mechanisms, and identify ways to optimize the absorption-reduction effect. The theory is compared to the results of a recent experiment (on a ladder-type system), using the Rb D2 line, with generally very good agreement. The maximum absorption reduction observed (64.4%) appears to be mostly limited by the relatively large (5 MHz) linewidth of the diode lasers used in our experiment. {\textcopyright} 1995 The American Physical Society.},
