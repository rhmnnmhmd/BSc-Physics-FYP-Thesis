(Coherent) superflash is one of the coherent transient phenomena that can be observed when an incident probe laser beam that propagates through a medium is abruptly turned off either through amplitude or phase modulation. To study more on the behaviour of superflash, a numerical simulation of the transmitted field has been devised in Python programming language. This language utilizes the Fast Fourier Transform(FFT) package to obtain the time-evolution of the transmitted field $E_{t}(t, z)$ by calculating the Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) of the transmitted field's spectrum $E_{t}(\omega, z)$. The objective of this project is to extend the knowledge on superflash regarding one of its characteristic parameters which is the forward-scattered intensity $I_{s}$ in another type of medium. The medium studied in this project is a 3-level Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) medium instead of a 2-level medium as discussed in \cite{Kwong2014}. The important result discovered from this project is the tunability of the superflash that cannot be obtained in a 2-level medium. Concisely, it can be stated that the result produced here showed that when the medium is changed from a 2-level medium to a 3-level EIT medium, unique spectral features are observed near medium resonance contrary to the 2-level case where it is monotonous without any interesting feature.
