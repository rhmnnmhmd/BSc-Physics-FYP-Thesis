Coherent superflash is one of the coherent transient phenomena that can be observed when an incident probe laser beam that propagates through a medium is abruptly turned off either through amplitude or phase modulation. To study more on the behavior of coherent superflash, a numerical simulation of the transmitted signal has been devised in the Python programming language. This language utilizes the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) package to obtain the time-evolution of the transmitted signal $E_{t}(t, z)$ by calculating the Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) of the transmitted signal's spectrum $E_{t}(\omega, z)$. The objective of this project is to extend the knowledge on coherent superflash regarding its characteristic parameters e.g. forward-scattered intensity $I_{s}$ to another new type of medium that is the 3-level Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) medium instead of the usual 2-level medium as discussed in \cite{Kwong2014}. The important result discovered from this project is the detuning tunability of the superflash that cannot be obtained in 2-level medium. Concisely, it can be stated that the result produced here showed that when the medium is changed from 2-level medium to a 3-level EIT medium, unique spectral features are observed near medium resonance contrary to the 2-level case where it is monotonous without any interesting feature.
