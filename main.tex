\acknowledgements{First and foremost, I would like to thank my project supervisor, Associate Professor Doctor Jeong Heejeong for her commitment and patience in guiding me throughout this project.

I also would like to thank my parents for being an understanding and supportive figure for me in the current tough times with the full-online and at-home study session that have been going for 3 semesters.

Finally, not to forget, I also want to send my love and appreciation for my friends and colleagues that have been always keeping in touch with me even with the difficulty of online class etc.}
