\chapter{Methodology}
In this project, methodology are separated into 2 phases. The 1st phase are considered the preliminary phase where the literature review are done related to this project's topic. The 2nd phase is the methodology related to reproducing simulations/plots from previous paper and generating new simulation results using the Python codes developed in this project. This chapter will be divided into 4 sections. The general methodological approach implemented in this project will be discussed in the 1st section. Next, the data collection methods will be discussed in the 2nd section. Furthermore, the methods of analysis will be presented in the 3rd section. Finally, this chapter will end with providing justifications for all the methodological choices in this project.

\section{General Methodological Approach}
This project's main objective is to study the behaviour of superflash $I_{s}$ in a new type of medium that is a 3-level EIT medium. As far as the literature review of superflash goes, all of their setup only involved using a 2-level medium, none can be found to be using a 3-level EIT medium \cite{Kwong2014, Kwong2015, Kwong2017, Kwong2020}. In terms of the study of Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) itself, example of referred articles is \citeNP{Gea-Banacloche1995, Braje2004}. From all of these cited articles, 2 articles can be pointed out as the inspiration to this project that is \citeNP{Kwong2014} and \citeNP{jeong2010slow}. \citeNP{Kwong2014} provides the idea of studying the detuning spectrum of the forward-scattered intensity $I_{s}$ (which is basically the superflash) while \citeNP{jeong2010slow} lay out the necessary details e.g. medium susceptibility $\chi$ and medium refractive index $n$ for a 3-level EIT medium.

To achieve the aim of "discovering" new behaviour of superflash in the 3-level EIT medium, the most important component is to generate the forward-scattered intensity $I_{s}$ as a function of incident probe detuning $\Delta$ (Will be called $I_{s}$ spectrum from here on) in a 3-level EIT medium. In terms of data types used in this project, all of it are primary data (e.g. temporal profile of the transmitted intensity and detuning spectrum simulation plots) that are generated by the Python simulation code that were developed here. Nevertheless, the important parameters such as the incident pulse length and the medium parameters are adapted from \citeNP{jeong2010slow}.

The data collected consist of the simulation plots in the temporal and frequency domain. There's only one type of plot for the temporal-domain. It is the simulation for the transmitted intensity $I_{t}(t, z)$. The code for this simulation will be discussed further in data analysis section. For the frequency-domain data (e.g. detuning spectrum) there are 4 main simulations consisting of the $I_{s}$ spectrum, steady-state transmission spectrum $I_{ss}$, phase shifts spectrum $\Delta\phi$ and absorption coefficient spectrum $a$. The study of the behaviour of superflash was mainly focused on the EIT-control parameter which is the incident coupling laser's Rabi frequency $\Omega_{c}$. This important parameter were varied and response from the frequency-domain plots were observed. Then, through analysis, a hypothesis was proposed for the cause/mechanism of the observed changes.


\section{Data Collection Methods}
The data collection methods in this project involves simulating and generating the desired temporal and spectral profiles using Python programming language. Python programming language are chosen for developing the simulation code in this project because of our familiarity with it and its simplicity. So, in collecting the relevant plots, the completed Python codes were executed and the outputs consisting of a figure of a plot are recorded and saved in an organized folders. There are 5 main Python codes involved in this project and all of it are able to generate simulation for both 2-level (by setting $\Omega_{c} = 0$) and 3-level EIT medium (by setting $\Omega_{c} \neq 0$). The first code for plotting the temporal profile for the transmitted intensity (which is the most important one) will be discussed in the first subsection here. This first code is the most crucial one because the data points in the second code for plotting the $I_{s}$ spectrum are extracted from iteration of the first code for different incident probe laser detuning $\Delta$. This will be discussed in detail in the second subsection. Next, in the third subsection, the third code involving plotting spectrum of the steady-state transmitted intensity $I_{ss}$ will be discussed. Afterwards, the fourth code that functions to plot the spectrum of the phase shift of the transmitted field $\Delta\phi$ will be elaborated in the fourth subsection. At last, the final code for plotting the spectrum of the absorption coefficient $a$ will be discussed in the last subsection of this Methodology chapter.

\subsection{Simulating The Temporal Profile of The Transmitted Intensity $I_{t}(t, z)$}\label{temporalProfile}
In simulating the transmitted intensity, there are 3 important aspects in the code. The first two aspects are closely-related to the physics and mathematical expression concerning the incident pulse and the medium. The third aspect are related to the manipulation of the initial output array of the transmitted field into a final output array through several lines of codes.

Firstly, the transmitted field $E_{t}(t, z)$ are acquired by performing an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) on the frequency-domain transmitted field $E_{t}(\omega, z)$. IFFT is basically the numerical version of the analytical Inverse Fourier Transform (IFT). The FFT/IFFT-related procedure are executed using the built-in FFT/IFFT function in the Python's SciPy/NumPy module. The frequency-domain transmitted field can be expressed as Equation \ref{eqn: E(w, z)} according to \citeNP{jeong2006thesis}.

\begin{equation}
    E_{t}(\omega, z) = E_{0}(\omega, z) e^{i k(\omega) z}
    \label{eqn: E(w, z)}
\end{equation}

Where;

\begin{itemize}
    \item $E_{0}(\omega, z)$ is the frequency-domain incident field which is acquired by performing an FFT to the time-domain incident field $E_{0}(t, z)$
    \item $e^{i k(\omega) z}$ are called the Transfer function of the medium which characterize the medium response towards the incident field
    \item $k(\omega) = \frac{\omega_{0}}{c} n(\omega) = \frac{\omega_{0}}{c} \sqrt{1 + \chi(\omega)}$ is the complex wavenumber of the incident field. $\omega_{0}$ is the medium's resonant angular frequency.
\end{itemize}

Since the frequency-domain incident field $E_{0}(\omega, z)$ have been obtained from the FFT, we are left with the explicit expression for $k(\omega)$ in the code through specifying the expression for $\chi(\omega)$. For EIT medium, $\chi(\omega)$ can be expressed as Equation \ref{eqn: chi(w)} according to \citeNP{Jeong2009, Braje2004}. After all of these are specified, the IFFT are performed giving us the "initial" time-domain transmitted field labeled as "E" in the code. This time-domain transmitted field are labeled as the "initial" one because it actually doesn't outputs the proper temporal profile when its intensity are plotted. This initial output array of the transmitted field will be an inverted temporal profile as shown in Figure \ref{fig: compare temporal}a while the correct one, Figure \ref{fig: compare temporal}b are produced after some modification of the initial transmitted field array.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 1\textwidth]{Figures/compareTemporal2.PNG}
    \caption[Comparison of The Temporal Profile of The Transmitted Intensity Before and After Array Modification]{Comparison between the temporal profile that is acquired a) before output array manipulation and b) after output array manipulation.}
    \label{fig: compare temporal}
\end{figure}

For the manipulation of the initial output array $E$, it is closely related to the ignition point, extinction point and the total duration of the pulse (including the instance where it is not switched-on). In determining the final form of the transmitted field array, the first step taken in the code is to find the element index where the pulse is switched on (ignition) and switched off (extinction). In the code, both this important element indices are labeled as \textit{upIndex} and \textit{downIndex} for ignition point and extinction point respectively. Next is the part for "constructing" the final transmitted field array (Defined as "$Efinal$" in the code). To do this, it consist of carefully choosing 3 different "sections" of the initial transmitted field array $E$ depending on the \textit{upIndex}, \textit{downIndex} and the total number of data points in the whole transmitted electric field array defined as $N$ which throughout this project are set to $80,000$. The process of choosing the correct 3 sections of array for the final transmitted electric field array involve a short If-Else statements in the code. Finally, after all of of the above have been executed and programmed properly, we get the final transmitted electric field defined as \textit{Efinal}. Then, to plot the transmitted intensity $I_{t}(t, z)$, we take the absolute value of the final transmitted field array and square it. Then, it is plotted against the time array which throughout this project, the pulse length is $2.5 \cdot 10^{-6}$ sec (including both the instance where pulse is turned on and turned off). The plotting is accomplished through one of Python's plotting module, the \textit{Matplotlib} module.

\subsection{Simulating The Forward-Scattered Intensity Spectrum $I_{s}$}\label{forwardScattered}
The process of plotting the $I_{s}$ spectrum involve finding the transmitted intensity $I_{t}$ at the extinction point for various different detunings. For example, the plot in Figure \ref{fig: compare temporal}b are the temporal profile for the resonant case ($\Delta = 0$). So, we vary this detuning starting from a negative detuning (e.g. $\Delta = -30\gamma_{eg}$) up  till a positive detuning (e.g. $\Delta = 30\gamma_{eg}$) to create a symmetrically-centered $I_{s}$ spectrum at $\Delta = 0$. For each of the temporal profile at a specific detuning, we find the max value of the transmitted intensity in the region starting from the extinction point up to 200 data points after the extinction point. This maximum value are then assigned as one of the element in the $I_{s}$ spectrum array defined as \textit{IsArray} in the code. Not to forget, the x-axis for the plot which consists of all the detunings are put into an array defined as \textit{detuningArray} in the code. In term of code, this iteration of acquiring different value of $I_{s}$ for different detunings $\Delta$ are achieved through a simple While-Loop. The looping of this While-Loop depends on the value of the detuning. Meaning that, the initial detuning will be applied then incremented by a certain chosen value (Increment chosen is $2.5 \cdot 10^{6}$) at the end of the loop. Then, the loop condition is checked whether it is still satisfied. For the loop to continue, the detuning value must be in the range $-30\gamma_{eg}$ up till $30\gamma_{eg}$. Finally, after both the $I_{s}$ array (\textit{IsArray}) and the detuning array $\Delta$ (\textit{detuningArray}) has been completed, the plotting process are as usual using the Python's \textit{Matplotlib} module similar to what have been done in Section \ref{temporalProfile}. 

\subsection{Simulating The Steady-State Transmitted Intensity $I_{ss}$}\label{steady}
To plot the steady-state transmitted intensity $I_{ss}$ is very simple compared to the previous 2 plots in Section \ref{temporalProfile} and \ref{forwardScattered}. As usual, the important parameters e.g. medium resonant wavelength and OD are defined. Next, the most important part is defining the susceptibility $\chi$ because it is part of the complex wavenumber $k$. The medium absorption coefficient is defined as $a = 2\Im{k}$. Then, according to \citeNP{boyd2020nonlinear}, the steady-state intensity is defined as;

\begin{equation}
    I_{ss}(\Delta) = I_{0} e^{-a(\Delta) z}
    \label{eqn: Iss}
\end{equation}

Then, in the code, the detuning array are created with value from $-30\gamma_{eg}$ until $30\gamma_{eg}$ with a total of $453$ data points (This value is chosen to match the total number of data points generated for the $I_{s}$ array in Section \ref{forwardScattered}). The steady-state intensity array in the code (denoted as \textit{I}) are defined similarly as in Equation \ref{eqn: Iss} (assuming it's normalized). Finally, with all of the above set up, the plot is generated using Python's \textit{Matplotlib} module. An example of its plot can be seen in Figure \ref{fig: steady}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 1\textwidth]{Figures/steady.png}
    \caption[Plot of Steady-State Transmission As A Function of Incident Probe Laser Detuning]{Plot of the steady-state transmission $I_{ss}$ as a function of (normalized) incident probe laser detuning $\frac{\Delta}{\gamma_{eg}}$ for 3-level EIT medium. The incident coupling laser's Rabi frequency $\Omega_{c} = 4.2\gamma_{eg}$ and the optical depth $OD = 62$. Further details on the medium and incident field are as mentioned previously and in \protect\citeNP{jeong2010slow}.}
    \label{fig: steady}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Simulating The Phase Shift of The Transmitted Field $\Delta\phi$}
For the phase shift, the x-axis which is the detuning array are also identical to the one defined in Section \ref{steady}. The only difference is in the definition of phase shift. According to \citeNP{boyd2020nonlinear}, the phase of and electric field $\phi$ is defined as;

\begin{equation}
    \phi = \Re{k} z
    \label{eqn: phase}
\end{equation}

The phase shift $\Delta\phi$ is defined as the difference between the phase in Equation \ref{eqn: phase} and "resonant" phase of the electric field $\phi_{0}$;

\begin{equation}
    \phi_{0} = k_{0}z
\end{equation}

Where;

\begin{itemize}
    \item $k_{0} = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda_{0}}$ is the medium's resonant wavenumber. $\lambda_{0}$ is the medium resonant wavelength.
    \item $z$ is the thickness into the medium where the phase shift is measured/calculated (usually at the end of the medium denoted $z = L$)
\end{itemize}

So, as shown in the code, this difference between these 2 phases are defined as \textit{phaseShift}. For convenience, it is normalized with respect to $\pi$ defining a new variable \textit{phaseShiftNorm}. After this is acquired, the process of plotting are simple using again Python's \textit{Matplotlib} module. The \textit{phaseShiftNorm} array are plotted against \textit{detuningArrayNorm} (normalized \textit{detuningArray} with respect to $\gamma_{eg}$). An example of the plot are shown in Figure \ref{fig: phase}.

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width = 0.9\textwidth]{Figures/phase.png}
    \caption[Plot of The Phase Shift Between The Transmitted Field and The Incident Field As A Function of Incident Probe Laser Detuning]{Plot of the normalized phase shift $\frac{\Delta\phi}{\pi}$ against the normalized incident probe laser detuning $\frac{\Delta}{\gamma_{eg}}$. The coupling laser's Rabi frequency is $\Omega_{c} = 4.2\gamma_{eg}$ while the medium's optical depth $OD = 62$}
    \label{fig: phase}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Simulating The Absorption Coefficient $a$ of The Medium}
Finally, for the absorption coefficient, the detuning array are also completely identical to the one discussed in previous sections. The normalized detuning array that will be used as the x-axis is defined as \textit{detuningArrayNorm}. For the absorption coefficient, it's defined according to \citeNP{boyd2020nonlinear};

\begin{equation}
    a = 2 \Im{k}
\end{equation}

Using the above definition for absorption coefficient. We defined in the code \textit{absCoeff} as the absorption coefficient. Finally, using these 2 constructed arrays, \textit{absCoeff} is plotted against \textit{detuningArrayNorm} utilizing Python's \textit{Matplotlib} module. An example of the generated plot are shown in Figure \ref{fig: abs}.

    \label{fig: abs}
\end{figure}


\section{Data Analysis Methods}
\subsection{Descriptive Data Analysis}
The change in the $I_{s}$ spectrum between a 2-level medium and a 3-level EIT medium were observed and recorded. This is to visualize and answer what is the difference when the type of medium are changed. For example, the main change that were observed going from $\Omega_{c} = 0$ to $\Omega_{c} = 4.2\gamma_{eg}$ is the introduction of a new spectral feature in the $I_{s}$ spectrum near the resonance. This change can be seen in Figure \ref{fig: comparing Is spectrum}. 

\subsection{Exploratory Data Analysis}
When the EIT effect was initially enabled ($\Omega_{c} = 4.2\gamma_{eg}$), the first change observed in the $I_{s}$ spectrum is the formation of a new spectral feature near resonance as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig: comparing Is spectrum}. Next, we varied coupling laser's Rabi frequency $\Omega_{c}$ to explore further change that could be observed in the structure of the $I_{s}$ spectrum. From this, different outputs of the $I_{s}$ spectrum for different $\Omega_{c}$ were compiled in Figure \ref{fig: Is compared to transmission & phase shift} (The solid red curve). Two observations can be concluded from Figure \ref{fig: Is compared to transmission & phase shift}. Firstly, when EIT effect is initially enabled (From $\Omega_{c} = 0$ to $\Omega_{c} = 4.2\gamma_{eg}$), new spectral feature with peak value close to the peak value at the wing of the $I_{s}$ spectrum appeared near resonance. Secondly, as the Rabi frequency $\Omega_{c}$ is increased, the whole $I_{s}$ spectrum "widens". Consequently, the new spectral feature near resonance become more resolved. In addition to that, both the peak points of the $I_{s}$ spectrum at the wing of the spectrum shifts further away from resonance. This results to the increase of the detuning value at the said shifted peak points (this detuning value is known as the maximal detuning $\Delta_{max}$). Further details of this observation are discussed in Section \ref{results and analysis}.


\section{Reliability and Viability of The Methodological Choices}
The main methodological choices made in this project is to use Python programming language as the main tool to discover new behaviour of the $I_{s}$ spectrum in a 3-level EIT medium and to further use it to explore and study the relationship between the $I_{s}$ spectrum with many other parameters such as the coupling laser's Rabi frequency $\Omega_{c}$, the optical depth (OD) and the probe detuning $\Delta$. Still, the main focus for this project is the relationship with the EIT parameter $\Omega_{c}$.

The reason Python programming language were chosen as a platform to develop the simulation codes are because of its FFT/IFFT functions in the \textit{Numpy} module. Other programming language e.g. Mathematica also have this kind of modules/packages but Python were chosen because our familiarity with the language and its syntax simplicity. The FFT and IFFT functions are really important because it is used in acquiring the spectrum of the incident field $E_{0}(\omega, z)$ and the time-domain transmitted field $E_{t}(t, z)$ respectively.

As discussed previously in Section \ref{precursor}, there are 2 main approaches in obtaining the transmitted field for a certain pulse propagation problem. The first method is the FFT/IFFT approach that was implemented in this project. The second method is the numerical asymptotic method. Both of these method are widely used by researcher either implementing one of the approach or combining both approaches. The reason FFT/IFFT approach was chosen for this project is because of its mathematical simplicity and ease of its application numerically. Furthermore, many of the numerical results from FFT/IFFT approach has been proven to be valid and agrees well with experimental data \cite{Macke2013, Oughstun2010, Jeong2008, jeong2010slow}. Even though numerical asymptotic approach could also produce accurate and valid results, FFT/IFFT method still outweighs them because it can produce similar results with less theoretical complexity. Even then, numerical asymptotic analysis still have its own pros over the FFT/IFFT approach for example in studying optically thin medium when asymptotic approximation are applicable. An example of paper that implemented numerical asymptotic analysis in their research is \citeNP{Jeong2009}.

To summarize, FFT/IFFT approach are chosen for acquiring the transmitted field for this project over the numerical asymptotic method because of its theoretical simplicity and its widespread implementation in many other research papers with valid results that closely match the experimental results.
